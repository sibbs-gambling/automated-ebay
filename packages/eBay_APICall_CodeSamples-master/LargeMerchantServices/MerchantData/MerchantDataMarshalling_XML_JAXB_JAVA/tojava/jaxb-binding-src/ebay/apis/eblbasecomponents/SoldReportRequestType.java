/**
 * 
 * 				Lists all items that have been sold by this seller. If a buyer purchased multiple
 * 				items from a single listing, the sale will result in a single Order ID for the total purchase
 * 				with a separate Line Item ID for each of the purchased items. The SoldReport request returns
 * 				the data for all of your new orders (newly-sold items) with Order ID and Order Line Item ID.
 * 				The Sold Report includes all transactions for the past 30 days (from the transaction creation date).
 * 				<br/><br/>
 *             <span class="tablenote">
 *             <strong>Note:</strong> SoldReport cannot be issued on its own like an ordinary API call, using an endpoint. This Large Merchant Services call must be invoked as a parameter in a Bulk Data Exchange API call, which will produce a report that can be downloaded using a File Transfer API call. This call has no request type. 
 *             </span>
 * 				<br><br>
 * 				The concept of an 'Order' is only used in the Trading API when a buyer makes combined payments.
 * 				Each payment is a transaction. But in the Large Merchant Services solution, every sale is considered
 * 				to be an Order. It is important to recognize these conceptual differences when you are working
 * 				with multiple APIs.
 * 				<br><br>
 * 				OrderLineItemID is a based upon the combination of the eBay Trading API's ItemID  and
 * 				TransactionID fields. The number before the hyphen is the Item ID and the number after the hyphen
 * 				is the Transaction ID. The Transaction field in the Trading API is a container that can include
 * 				many types of transaction information.
 * 				<br><br>
 * 				See <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/XML/docs/Reference/eBay/GetSellerTransactions.html#Response.TransactionArray.Transaction.TransactionID" target="_blank">Trading API</a>
 * 				for more information.
 * 				<br><br>
 * 				Sellers use the information in the SoldReport to make inventory updates and start order fulfillment.
 *             <br><br>
 *             <span class="tablenote">
 * 				<b>Note:</b> After release 637, a namespace is returned in the BulkDataExchangeResponseType (top level) of the
 * 				response. This container is not shown in the call output description, but you can see it in the call
 * 				samples at the end of this page. See <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/large-merchant-services/Concepts/MakingACall.html" target="_blank">Making An API Call</a> for more information about the BulkDataExchange Response container.
