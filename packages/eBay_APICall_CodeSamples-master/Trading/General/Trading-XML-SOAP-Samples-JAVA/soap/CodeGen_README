--------------------------

Getting Started:
================

1) Verify that you have Java 1.5.x or higher installed. You can verify your 
   Java installation by opening a command prompt and typing:
   
	> java -version

2) Verify that you have Apache Ant installed and that you have 
   properly configured the ANT_HOME environment variable. You can 
   read more about installing Ant here: 
   
   	http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html
   	
   After installing Ant you can verify your installation by opening a command
   prompt and typing:
   
	> ant

   A successful installation of Ant should throw an error saying that 'build.xml
   does not exist!'.

3) Verify that you have the Apache Axis libraries on your system. Specifically,
   you should have the following Java libraries in your $axis_install\lib\ directory:
	
	axis.jar
	axis-ant.jar
	commons-discovery.jar
	commons-logging.jar
	jaxrpc.jar
	log4j-1.2.8.jar
	saaj.jar
	wsdl4j.jar
	
   where $axis_install is the location that you downloaded and unzipped Apache Axis 
    to.  If you do not have the above jars, you can find them in the externalJars folder 
	provided in the zipped package.

4) Edit codeGen.xml build scirpt and make sure to point the axis.home property to your Axis installation directory

5) Execute codeGen.xml as below to build eBay Transing Web Service client stub:
   ant -f codeGen.xml 
   
   the Ant build script downloads the latest WSDL 
      from the Ebay site, runs the WSDL2Java task (which creates Java classes from 
      the WSDL). The build file checks to see if the local copy of the WSDL file is 
      different from the copy available on:
   
   	http://developer.ebay.com/webservices/latest/ebaySvc.wsdl
   
      If the files match, the source files are not generated and the build proceeds
   as normal.
