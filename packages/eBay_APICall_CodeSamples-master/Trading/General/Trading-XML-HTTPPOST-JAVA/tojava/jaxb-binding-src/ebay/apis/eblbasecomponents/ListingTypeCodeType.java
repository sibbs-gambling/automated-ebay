     *             Formerly, this was a fixed-price format for eBay Store sellers.
     *             <br><br>
     *             As of March 30, 2010, the FixedPriceItem listing type has replaced the
     *             StoresFixedPrice listing type on all eBay sites.
     *             The StoresFixedPrice listing type will be deprecated in early 2011.
     *             Currently, AddItem
     *             and AddFixedPriceItem accept either FixedPriceItem or StoresFixedPrice as listing
     *             types, but the item is displayed as FixedPriceItem on the site and in search
     *             results. GetItem and other 'Get' calls will return the listing type you originally
     *             used in the request. Therefore, the preferred format is FixedPriceItem.
     *             <br><br>
     * 						In additon to the changes mentioned above, items added as StoresFixedPrice listing
     * 						type are treated as FixedPriceItem listing type on the site. Items will immediately
     * 						get the higher FixedPriceItem exposure, and will renew or relist at the FixedPriceItem
     * 						price.
     *             <br><br>
     * 						Any listing enhancements (e.g., bold, subtitle, etc.) will also renew or relist at
     * 						FixedPriceItem (higher) rates.
     *             <br><br>
     *             To list a product for a store, you can simply substitute FixedPriceItem as the listing
     *             type where the StoresFixedPrice listing type used to be within your AddItem call. Like
     *             StoresFixedPrice, the FixedPriceItem listing type has permitted durations of 30 days
     *             and GTC for store and non-store subscribers (in addition to the previously permitted
     *             durations of 3, 5, 7, and 10 days).
